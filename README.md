## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based, turn-based card game designed and built from scratch to model complex game logic, player decision-making, and state management. The game simulates structured turns, resource constraints, combat resolution, and win conditions, requiring careful coordination between multiple interacting systems.

The project was developed using object-oriented programming principles, with clearly defined classes for players, decks, cards, and game flow. Core mechanics include deck construction, random card draws, energy management, turn sequencing, attack resolution, and health tracking. The system also handles edge cases such as empty decks, reshuffling logic, and game-ending conditions.

Development emphasized clean, modular code, allowing individual components (such as cards, players, or rulesets) to be modified or extended without rewriting the entire system. The project was iteratively built and refined through testing, debugging, and refactoring to ensure consistent behavior across game states.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python (object-oriented design, classes, methods, control flow)
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, queues)
- State management and rule-based systems
- Debugging, testing, and iterative development
- Writing modular, maintainable code

## Relevance to Analytics & Technical
While this project is not domain-specific, it demonstrates skills directly applicable to analytics and technical problem-solving roles, including:
- Translating real-world rules and constraints into logical systems
- Breaking down complex problems into structured components
- Managing state, dependencies, and edge cases
- Iterating based on observed outcomes and system behavior
- Building extensible systems that could support data-driven inputs
