## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based turn-based card game built to practice object-oriented design, game state logic, and decision-based mechanics.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python (classes, functions, control flow)
- Data structures and game state tracking
- Debugging and iterative development
- Writing maintainable, modular code

## Relevance to Analytics
While this project is not baseball-focused, it demonstrates my ability to:
- Break down complex systems into logical components
- Model rules and constraints programmatically
- Iterate based on observed behavior and outcomes
- Build systems that could be extended to data-driven decision making
